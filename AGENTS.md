## Loop protocol

Every task runs as a loop, not a line:

1. Write the change.
2. Run the checks: tests, linter, type checker.
3. If anything fails, read the error, fix the cause, go back to step 2.
4. Repeat up to 5 times.

Stop conditions:
- All checks pass: report "done" with the passing output as proof.
- 5 attempts used: stop and report what still fails and what you tried.
- Same error appears twice in a row: stop. You're guessing, not fixing.

Never report "done" without check output from this session.
Never fix a test by weakening it. Fix the code, not the test.
